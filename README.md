### Lessons Learned

#### 1. Add a LazyQuery inside of the useEffect to run a query only in a certain condition
Author: Minami

We wanted to allow any users to see the details of the individual recipe, and when the user is already logged in, check if the user has already pinned that recipe or not to load the pin icon according to if the user has previously pinned that recipe or not. The query to get the userdata needs to run when the user is signed in. React doesn't allow the useQuery to be added inside of the if statment, such as 
```
if (loggedIn) {
    getUser({variables: { username: Auth.getProfile().authentigatedPerson.username}})
}
```
In order to achieve this without getting error returned from the server by trying to query the userdata when user is not signed in, I used `useLazyQuery` instead of `useQuery` and put the query inside of the `useEffect` I could conditionally run the query to check the userdata.
